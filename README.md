# Customer-Churning_ML-project 
This project is about customer churning in a Telco. It is to predict the which customers of the Telco will leave the company. This will benefit the company by helping it find out why they would want to leave and also streamline its product offering to the customers. 
There is a comprehensive description in the code in a Markdown format and would help you get a deeper understanding of this project.
